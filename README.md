ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Walker

I'm a mathematician and data scientist based in San Francisco. I'm interested in using AI to fight wildfires and identify changes 
in implied volatility regimes in SP500 data. But really I just think math, computer science, and econometrics are awesome. 

Outside of work I enjoy backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas and Brazilian jiu-jitsu =]
