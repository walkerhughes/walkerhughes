ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Walker

I'm a mathematician and machine learning engineer based in San Francisco. I'm currently building **yieldcurvecentral.com**, a one-stop solution for AI-enabled analysis of the US Treasury Yield Curve.

Beginning in the Summer of 2024, I'm returning to school for an MS in Data Science at the University of San Francisco. Outside of work I enjoy backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu =]
