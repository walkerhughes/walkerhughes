ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Walker

I'm a mathematician and machine learning engineer based in San Francisco. I'm currently building [www.yieldcurvecentral.com](https://www.yieldcurvecentral.com/), a one-stop solution for AI-enabled analysis of the US Treasury Yield Curve in the browser.

Previously, I: 
> - Completed large-scale SaaS implementations involving complex data engineering challenges at Addepar, a FinTech unicorn based in Mountain View, CA
> - Leveraged state-of-the-art statistical modelling for high-stakes commercial lawsuits at Cornerstone Research, a leading economic consulting firm in San Francisco 
> - Conducted deep learning research at BYU focused on computer vision applications, and was a course assistant for Machine Learning for Economics and Econometrics 

Beginning in the Summer of 2024, I'm returning to school for an MS in Data Science at the University of San Francisco. Outside of work I enjoy backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu =]
