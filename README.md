ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Walker

I'm an applied mathematician and data scientist based in San Francisco. Beginning in the Summer of 2024, I'll be returning to school for an MS in Data Science at the University of San Francisco. 

Outside of work I enjoy backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu =]

Feel free to take a look at some of my recent projects below!
