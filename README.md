ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Walker

I'm a computational mathematician and economist. I'm interested in using AI to fight wildfires and identify changes 
in implied volatility regimes that would be useful for options traders. But really I just think math, computer science, and econometrics are awesome. 

Besides writing code, I like backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas and trying new foods here in San Francisco!
