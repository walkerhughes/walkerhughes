👋 Hi, I’m Walker

I'm a machine learning engineer based in San Francisco. I currently work at `hyprbm`, where I'm building topic models for emotional intelligence in conversational data. I'm passionate about tech, backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. 

I'm currently focused on
- 💻 Building topic models for fast inference in conversational data
- 🌲 Adapting Monte-Carlo Tree Search methods in novel domains

Previously, I
- 📈 Owned data engineering workflows in SaaS implementations at Addepar, a FinTech unicorn based in Mountain View
- 👨‍⚖️ Leveraged SOTA statistical modeling in high-stakes litigation at Cornerstone Research, where I contributed to one of the first Expert Reports utilizing NLP in commercial litigation
- 👁️ Was a deep learning researcher in undergrad focused on computer vision, and was a course assistant for Causal ML methods in the Economics Department
