ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Walker

I'm a mathematician and machine learning engineer based in San Francisco. I'm currently building [www.yieldcurvecentral.com](https://www.yieldcurvecentral.com/), a one-stop solution for AI-enabled analysis of the US Treasury Yield Curve. I'm passionate about tech, backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. 

Previously, I: 
> - Completed large-scale SaaS implementations involving complex data engineering challenges at Addepar, a FinTech unicorn serving ultra-high-net-worth clients based in Mountain View, CA.
> - Leveraged state-of-the-art statistical modeling for high-stakes commercial lawsuits at Cornerstone Research, a leading economic consulting firm in San Francisco. I contributed to one of the first Expert Reports that utilized NLP methods in commercial litigation.
> - Conducted deep learning research at BYU focused on computer vision applications, and was a course assistant for Causal ML methods in the Economics Department.
